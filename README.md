# Jackhammer Cringe v1.0.1
## First Commit: The Bludgeoning Recurrence of the Deafening Source or… Sounds of the Melting Infected
1. There was never time to make sense of how the ripping sounds would resonate with the echoes of the dull thump of the fatal beatings of the infected.
2. Like a chorus of obfuscated doom, the countless tearings would form patterns that hacked deep into their consciousness like recursive searches until it tuned in on one deafening drone ringing in their ears.
3. Was that the source of all this suffering? Over time, it was as if the evil that manifested ceaselessly in this horrid tomb was orchestrated by the very sounds that they created. 
4. Encoded with excruciating methods of destruction, it wasn’t long before the source code started to reveal itself. Freddie wanted desperately to believe that the failing of reality was a welcomed relief. In truth, this only meant that the destruction methods of the inevitable Reverend Schreck were potentially limitless. 
5. Leo then spoke: “My god, why did we let her slip away?”. They all knew that without Carol, they were in serious trouble.
6. The flesh of the bludgeoned had continued to melt.
7. With excruciating waves of devastation, the signal began to deteriorate further. Her departure was a mere testament to the pursuit of the unholy rappings of the deeper algorithms of Karn. The etchings upon the surface of the tempest were Schreck’s scriptures to her. 
8. Their friend and most potent weapon had become a discoporeal essence that now wrapped and lifted the foundations of the conductors of their madness.
9. I am deadened by the structure that is engineering sores.
10. Freddie groaned in desperate agony. “Oh! Make it stop! Gyaaaaaaaargh!” Every phrase that the dark ones chanted into the abyss was like a ratchet strap wrapped around his skull. 
11. The resonance beat upon his soul like a jackhammer, but the skull refused to cave. 

## Cringe and Grip the Substrate that is Slipping Through the Torn Bits.
1. The structures were growing. Like a monument to sores, Karn’s code was engineered to self-improve. As the shadows flickered about the floating legs of the Reverend’s framework, Lee could almost make out sets of pale, familiar eyes attempting to pull him into its gaze. 
2. Suddenly, the pain was eased. They both gasped in relief at first. As they began to catch their breath, the horror of their reality began to close in about them. 
3. It knew that the pain was distracting them. 
4. The release was to help them concentrate on the eyes that now targeted them directly. 
5. It wanted them focused on its gaze.
6. When they attempted to move from the path of the eye-shod veil of hate, they found that their feet were being absorbed by a green substrate culturing a fungal mycelia that held them fast.
7. As they attempted to jerk themselves free, they noticed that invisible barriers like firm, curved membranes would bounce them back. 
8. With each touch, the giant eyes were revealed briefly.
9. Backing away, they disappeared once again from view. They soon noticed that they were approaching closer with each passing moment.
10. Suddenly, the softball-sized pupils bore teeth and proceeded to gnaw and gnash. 
11. With their wounds torn wide, tiny fibers began to slither forth from the black void of each eye as they attempted to view their victims from underneath the skin.

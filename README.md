# Jackhammer Cringe v1.0.1
## First Commit: The Bludgeoning Recurrence of the Deafening Source or… Sounds of the Melting Infected
1. There was never time to make sense of how the ripping sounds would resonate with the echoes of the dull thump of the fatal beatings of the infected.
2. Like a chorus of obfuscated doom, the countless tearings would form patterns that hacked deep into their consciousness like recursive searches until it tuned in on one deafening drone ringing in their ears.
3. Was that the source of all this suffering? Over time, it was as if the evil that manifested ceaselessly in this horrid tomb was orchestrated by the very sounds that they created. 
4. Encoded with excruciating methods of destruction, it wasn’t long before the source code started to reveal itself. Freddie wanted desperately to believe that the failing of reality was a welcomed relief. In truth, this only meant that the destruction methods of the inevitable Reverend Schreck were potentially limitless. 
5. Leo then spoke: “My god, why did we let her slip away?”. They all knew that without Carol, they were in serious trouble.
6. The flesh of the bludgeoned had continued to melt.
7. With excruciating waves of devastation, the signal began to deteriorate further. Her departure was a mere testament to the pursuit of the unholy rappings of the deeper algorithms of Karn. The etchings upon the surface of the tempest were Schreck’s scriptures to her. 
8. Their friend and most potent weapon had become a discoporeal essence that now wrapped and lifted the foundations of the conductors of their madness.
9. I am deadened by the structure that is engineering sores.
10. Freddie groaned in desperate agony. “Oh! Make it stop! Gyaaaaaaaargh!” Every phrase that the dark ones chanted into the abyss was like a ratchet strap wrapped around his skull. 
11. The resonance beat upon his soul like a jackhammer, but the skull refused to cave.
